In this level you will be working with registers. You will be asked to modify
or read from registers.

We will now set some values in memory dynamically before each run. On each run
the values will change. This means you will need to do some type of formulaic
operation with registers. We will tell you which registers are set beforehand
and where you should put the result. In most cases, its rax.


Another cool concept in x86 is the ability to independently access to lower register bytes.

Each register in x86_64 is 64 bits in size, and in the previous levels we have accessed
the full register using rax, rdi or rsi.

We can also access the lower bytes of each register using different register names.

For example the lower 32 bits of rax can be accessed using eax, the lower 16 bits using ax,
the lower 8 bits using al.

the values will change. This means you will need to do some type of formulaic
operation with registers. We will tell you which registers are set beforehand
and where you should put the result. In most cases, its rax.

In this level you will be working with memory. This will require you to read or write
to things stored linearly in memory. If you are confused, go look at the linear
addressing module in 'ike. You may also be asked to dereference things, possibly multiple
times, to things we dynamically put in memory for your use.


Up until now you have worked with registers as the only way for storing things, essentially
variables such as 'x' in math.

However, we can also store bytes into memory!

Recall that memory can be addressed, and each address contains something at that location.

Note that this is similar to addresses in real life!

As an example: the real address '699 S Mill Ave, Tempe, AZ
85281' maps to the 'ASU Brickyard'.

We would also say it points to 'ASU Brickyard'.

We can represent this like:
  ['699 S Mill Ave, Tempe, AZ 85281'] = 'ASU Brickyard'

The address is special because it is unique.

But that also does not mean other addresses can't point to the same thing (as someone can have multiple houses).

Memory is exactly the same!

For instance, the address in memory that your code is stored (when we take it from you) is 0x400000.

In x86 we can access the thing at a memory location, called dereferencing, like so:
  mov rax, [some_address]        <=>     Moves the thing at 'some_address' into rax

This also works with things in registers:
  mov rax, [rdi]         <=>     Moves the thing stored at the address of what rdi holds to rax

This works the same for writing to memory:
  mov [rax], rdi         <=>     Moves rdi to the address of what rax holds.

So if rax was 0xdeadbeef, then rdi would get stored at the address 0xdeadbeef:
  [0xdeadbeef] = rdi

Note: memory is linear, and in x86_64, it goes from 0 - 0xffffffffffffffff (yes, huge).

Please perform the following:
  Place the value stored at 0x404000 into rax

Make sure the value in rax is the original value stored at 0x404000.

We will now set the following in preparation for your code:
  [0x404000] = 0x19bb31

You ran me without an argument. You can re-run with `/challenge/run /path/to/your/elf` to input an ELF file, or just give me your assembled and extracted code in bytes (up to 0x1000 bytes):

Recall that registers in x86_64 are 64 bits wide, meaning they can store 64 bits.

Similarly, each memory location can be treated as a 64 bit value.

We refer to something that is 64 bits (8 bytes) as a quad word.

Here is the breakdown of the names of memory sizes:
  Quad Word   = 8 Bytes = 64 bits
  Double Word = 4 bytes = 32 bits
  Word        = 2 bytes = 16 bits
  Byte        = 1 byte  = 8 bits

In x86_64, you can access each of these sizes when dereferencing an address, just like using
bigger or smaller register accesses:
  mov al, [address]        <=>        moves the least significant byte from address to rax
  mov ax, [address]        <=>        moves the least significant word from address to rax
  mov eax, [address]       <=>        moves the least significant double word from address to rax
  mov rax, [address]       <=>        moves the full quad word from address to rax

Remember that moving into al does not fully clear the upper bytes.

Please perform the following:
  Set rax to the byte at 0x404000

operation with registers. We will tell you which registers are set beforehand
and where you should put the result. In most cases, its rax.

In this level you will be working with control flow manipulation. This involves using instructions
to both indirectly and directly control the special register `rip`, the instruction pointer.
You will use instructions such as: jmp, call, cmp, and their alternatives to implement the requested behavior.


Earlier, you learned how to manipulate data in a pseudo-control way, but x86 gives us actual
instructions to manipulate control flow directly.

There are two major ways to manipulate control flow:
 through a jump;
 through a call.

In this level, you will work with jumps.

There are two types of jumps:
  Unconditional jumps
  Conditional jumps

Unconditional jumps always trigger and are not based on the results of earlier instructions.

As you know, memory locations can store data and instructions.

Your code will be stored at 0x4000e5 (this will change each run).

For all jumps, there are three types:
  Relative jumps: jump + or - the next instruction.
  Absolute jumps: jump to a specific address.
  Indirect jumps: jump to the memory address specified in a register.

In x86, absolute jumps (jump to a specific address) are accomplished by first putting the target address in a register reg, then doing jmp reg.

In this level we will ask you to do an absolute jump.

Perform the following:
  Jump to the absolute address 0x403000

We will now set the following in preparation for your code:
  Loading your given code at: 0x4000e5

> Any far jump is absolute, any indirect jump is absolute, the combination (far, indirect) is therefore also absolute. Far jump only happen when necessary (you have to change `cs` and it's not a `call`). Indirect jumps are used for function pointers, branch tables (used in some cases for `switch` statements), dynamic dispatch (virtual methods) and maybe for imported functions (usually you call them, but maybe it's a tail call).

the values will change. This means you will need to do some type of formulaic
operation with registers. We will tell you which registers are set beforehand
and where you should put the result. In most cases, its rax.

In this level you will be working with control flow manipulation. This involves using instructions
to both indirectly and directly control the special register `rip`, the instruction pointer.
You will use instructions such as: jmp, call, cmp, and their alternatives to implement the requested behavior.


Recall that for all jumps, there are three types:
  Relative jumps
  Absolute jumps
  Indirect jumps

In this level we will ask you to do a relative jump.

You will need to fill space in your code with something to make this relative jump possible.

We suggest using the `nop` instruction. It's 1 byte long and very predictable.

In fact, the as assembler that we're using has a handy .rept directive that you can use to
repeat assembly instructions some number of times:
  https://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/gas-2.9.1/html_chapter/as_7.html

Useful instructions for this level:
  jmp (reg1 | addr | offset) ; nop

Hint: for the relative jump, lookup how to use `labels` in x86.

Using the above knowledge, perform the following:
  Make the first instruction in your code a jmp
  Make that jmp a relative jump to 0x51 bytes from the current position
  At the code location where the relative jump will redirect control flow set rax to 0x1

We will now set the following in preparation for your code:
