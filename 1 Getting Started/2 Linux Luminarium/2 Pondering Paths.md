# Prerequisite Knowledge

> This module will teach you the basics of Linux file paths!
>
> The Linux filesystem is a "tree". That is, it has a root (written as `/`). The root of the filesystem is a directory, and every directory can contain other directories and files. You refer to files and directories by their *path*. A path from the root of the filesystem starts with `/` (that is, the root of the filesystem), and describes the set of directories that must be descended into to find the file. Every piece of the path is demarcated with another `/`.

我的观点：

以/开头的描述文件或目录路径的，就是绝对地址

其他的都是相对地址

# 1-The Root

就是执行程序，执行这个位于根目录下的程序。

还是要好好的读题干啊，就读题干的英语。

# 2-Program and absoiute paths

pwd，这个指令告诉你，你现在在哪个目录下工作。

运行这个程序，没了。

但是不能使用相对路径。

# 3-Position thy self



```
i am lazy......
```



# 4-Position elsewhere



```
i am lazy......
```



# 5-Position yet elsewhere



```
i am lazy......
```



# 6-implicit relative paths, from /



```
i am lazy......
```



# 7-explicit relative paths, from /



```
i am lazy......
```



# 8-impilcit relative path



```
i am lazy......
```



# 9- home sweet home



```
i am lazy......
```
